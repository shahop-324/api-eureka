                “User Content” means any and all information and content that a
                user submits, uploads, displays, posts, or otherwise transmits
                to or through the Services (“Transmit”). You are solely

                You may not represent or imply to others that your User Content
                is in any way provided, sponsored or endorsed by Company.
                Because you alone are responsible for your User Content, you may

                violates the provisions of Section 8 below. Company is not
                obligated to you to preserve or provide backup services for any
                User Content, and your User Content may be deleted at any time
